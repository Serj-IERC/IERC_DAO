# IEIP-2 Proposal: Regarding Fee Adjustment Proposal

## Proposal Background and Situation Analysis

### Current Situation Description:

Currently, within the IERC20 platform, all transaction fees are borne by the buyer. This model is feasible in many market environments, but for specific markets, such as the inscription market, this mechanism may lead to buyers facing higher cost burdens. The high costs required to be paid by buyers could suppress their willingness to purchase, thereby affecting the liquidity and market vitality of the entire platform.

### Problem Identification:

The current fee structure may lead to reduced market efficiency, especially in buyer-oriented markets like the inscription market. The high costs could hinder the addition of new users and the expansion of the market.

## Proposal Objectives

### Reducing Buyer Costs:

By adjusting the fee collection mechanism to charge sellers, the direct costs incurred by buyers during transactions are reduced, enhancing buyers' willingness to purchase and the overall activity level of the market.

### Balancing the Interests of Market Participants:

Redesign the fee mechanism to ensure a more equitable cost-sharing between buyers and sellers while maintaining the platform's income stability.
