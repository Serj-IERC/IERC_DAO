## Governance and Tokenomics

Central to the effectiveness of IERC DAO is a robust governance structure and carefully crafted tokenomics. Governance within IERC DAO is predicated on the principles of decentralization, transparency, and community empowerment. The governance framework is designed to enable stakeholders to participate in the decision-making process, propose initiatives, and vote on key proposals. Through active participation and transparent governance mechanisms, stakeholders are empowered to shape the future direction of the IERC ecosystem.
Tokenomics plays a pivotal role in aligning incentives and rewarding valuable contributions within the IERC DAO ecosystem. The native governance token, $ethi, serves as a tool for governance and value capture, enabling token holders to participate in decision-making processes and receive rewards for their contributions.

## Stakeholders

The success of IERC DAO relies on the collaboration of various stakeholders, each with aligned incentives and dedicated to achieving the mission of IERC DAO.
IERC DAO is structured as follows:

**Committee Members**

Senior Committee Members are individuals who resonate with the mission and vision of IERC DAO and wish to contribute. They have access to IERC DAO's open activities and discussions on platforms like Discord and Telegram. These members can engage with the DAO by participating in bounties and other opportunities and possessing governance rights.

**Community Members**

Community Members are individuals who hold IERC DAO's inscription, $ethi. These inscriptions can be obtained through financial contributions or active involvement in the DAO's activities. Inscription holders enjoy comprehensive governance rights, allowing them to participate in decision-making processes via informal channels like Discord and Telegram, as well as formal inscription-based voting procedures such as Snapshot.

**Working Groups, Stewards, and Contributors**

IERC DAO establishes various working groups to advance its mission and vision. Each working group is led by a designated steward, responsible for defining the group's structure, setting specific KPIs, and assigning tasks. Contributors within these working groups may hold different roles, levels of responsibility, and engagement. Compensation for contributors is determined on a case-by-case basis and may include a combination of $ethi tokens and stablecoins.
Active Working Groups:

- Operations
- Governance & Tokenomics
- Multi-Signature Committee

**_The process of establishing a working group_**

The process of establishing a working group within IERC DAO follows a transparent and community-driven approach, ensuring alignment with the actual needs and development direction of the community. Proposals are typically initiated prior to the beginning of each quarter, followed by budget requests and other associated steps.
IERC DAO's working groups operate on a quarterly basis, emphasizing transparency, decentralization, and long-term development. Here's the basic process for establishing a working group:

1. Community Idea Proposals: Any community member can propose an idea for a working group to address community needs. The proposer organizes discussions among community members, collects feedback, and initiates forum voting.
2. Community Engagement: After forum voting begins, at least one round of community engagement is conducted to ensure consensus within the community. This emphasizes transparency and ensures widespread understanding and support for the working group's establishment.
3. Snapshot Proposal: Upon reaching community consensus, the proposer drafts a Snapshot proposal in accordance with the proposal requirements. The Senior Committee Group oversees the proposal's preparation, ensuring compliance with basic requirements. Once the proposal is voted on by the community, the working group is formally established.
4. Working Group Leadership: The proposer of the working group becomes its leader, responsible for coordinating the group's activities.
   IERC DAO's working group establishment process upholds principles of transparency and decentralization, encouraging active participation from all community members. Every voice is respected, providing opportunities for individuals to become working group leaders and contribute to the development of IERC DAO and the Web3 ecosystem.

**Service Providers**

Service providers engaged by IERC DAO include professionals offering a range of services such as technical development, NFT development, and more. Compensation for these services may be provided in stablecoins, $ethi tokens, or a combination thereof, with terms decided on a case-by-case basis.

## Staking

A dedicated staking pool will be opened for DAO members on https://app.ierc20.com/PoW-DPoS, allowing participants to stake $ethi and earn more DPoS points. Inscriptions staked will be locked for a period ranging from 3 to 12 months, offering potential annual yields. Holders will receive their staking rewards at 30-day intervals starting from the time they initiate their staking.

## GitHub and Snapshot in the IERC DAO Ecosystem

Within the expansive landscape of decentralized governance and community-driven ecosystems, platforms like GitHub and Snapshot play pivotal roles in facilitating community engagement, enabling transparent decision-making, and driving project funding. In the context of IERC DAO, these platforms serve as essential tools for empowering stakeholders, fostering collaboration, and advancing the collective goals of the ecosystem.

### GitHub

GitHub provides transparency into the development process of IERC DAO. Users can track the progress of development tasks, review issues, and participate in discussions around IERC features and enhancements. This transparency fosters community engagement and encourages collaboration among developers and stakeholders.

- Issue Tracking and Proposal Submission: Users can leverage GitHub's issue tracking system to submit proposals, report bugs, or suggest improvements to the IERC DAO. By opening an issue on GitHub, users can provide detailed descriptions of their proposals or concerns, including relevant information and supporting arguments. This allows for structured communication and facilitates the review process by DAO members and contributors.
- Snapshot for Decentralized Governance: Once an issue or proposal is submitted on GitHub, users can then proceed to Snapshot for decentralized governance and voting. Snapshot allows inscription holders to participate in on-chain voting on proposals, governance decisions, and resource allocation. Users can use Snapshot to cast their votes on GitHub proposals, providing a decentralized mechanism for decision-making within the DAO.

### Snapshot

Snapshot serves as a pivotal platform for governance and decision-making within the IERC DAO ecosystem, enabling community members to voice their opinions and shape the direction of the DAO.

- Transparent Governance: Snapshot facilitates transparent decision-making by recording all proposals, discussions, and voting outcomes on-chain. This transparency enhances accountability and fosters trust among participants, ensuring that governance decisions are made in the best interest of the community.

## Governance Framework Overview

The governance decisions of IERC DAO are vested in $ethi inscription holders, who publicly propose, discuss, and vote on IERC DAO proposals.

### IEIP Proposal

The IEIP (IERC Ecosystem Improvement Proposal) is a mechanism through which community members can propose changes, enhancements, or new features to the IERC ecosystem. These proposals are initiated, reviewed, and published by IERC DAO, and subsequently voted upon by the community through the Snapshot voting platform.

### Proposal Process Overview

Proposals serve as the primary means through which IERC DAO executes decisions allocates funds, and adjusts its strategies. These proposals may originate formally or informally. Informal discussions typically occur on Telegram or Discord. If these discussions lead to the need for a formal proposal, a member should upload a preliminary version on GitHub to gather community input. These initial proposals undergo refinement based on received feedback until they are ready to proceed. At this stage, the proposal on GitHub becomes the final version, with further edits restricted.
Proposals requiring structured governance must be submitted to Snapshot (on-chain voting) for a formal vote based on inscriptions.
IERC DAO will also utilize a soft governance mechanism via Snapshot to streamline decision-making and manage decision fatigue. This form of governance addresses smaller-scale decisions involving norms and local agreements, as observed in working groups or specific project evaluations. Notably, this soft governance approach excludes determinations related to governance, fund allocation, or treasury tokens.

### Initiating an IEIP Proposal Overview

**Phase I: Ideation**

- Duration: Open-ended.
- Tool: Telegram or Discord.
- Discussion platform: Github Issue
- Community members and $ethi holders initiate discussions by posting ideas and suggestions in the designated or Telegram chat or Discord Channel.
- Ideas and suggestions are discussed and refined on the IERC DAO Telegram chat or Discord Server. Once an idea or suggestion gathers sufficient support (20 reaction emojis), it is considered for Phase II.

**Phase II: Formalization**

- Duration: 3 Days.
- Tool: GitHub
- Proposals are posted on IERC DAO's GitHub for further discussion and refinement. IERC Core Team, Senior Committee Members, and the proposer will have a further discuss to make the proposal more feasible. There should be at least 1 online meeting. 
- If the proposal has been denied, there should be a comment and specific reason why it has been denied. 

**Phase III: Consensus**
- Duration: 7 Days.
- Tool: Snapshot.
- Phase II proposals with majority support progress to Phase III.
- Phase III proposals require majority approval with a 5% quorum of the circulating inscription supply through inscription-based voting.

## Treasury funds

### Scope of Treasury Fund Utilization

The IERC DAO treasury funds are managed on [Safe](https://safe.global/), enhancing accessibility and transparency for all community members. Below outline the permissible uses of IERC DAO treasury funds, which can be accessed through the designated Safe address (eth:0xxx wallet to be created). Funding requests falling within these categories should be detailed in proposals:

1. Community Projects: Allocated for personnel, development expenses, and infrastructure costs (e.g., servers, domain names) related to IERC DAO community projects.
2. Community Working Groups: Funds personnel, development fees, and infrastructure expenses (e.g., servers, domain names) for IERC DAO community working groups.
3. Personnel and Development Costs: Essential for sustaining IERC DAO community projects, covering personnel and development expenditures.
4. Large-Scale Initiatives: Targeted funding for significant IERC DAO initiatives.
5. External Collaborations: Financial support for IERC DAO's external cooperation projects.

### Financial Management

Revenue generated by the IERC DAO project is directed to the IERC DAO treasury on Safe, subject to distribution according to proposal guidelines.

### Multi-Signature Committee

The Multi-Signature Committee oversees the IERC DAO treasury. To qualify as a multi-signature member, individuals must undergo selection through forum proposal elections and Snapshot proposal voting. Only those holding a Senior Committee Member status are eligible for nomination as a multi-signature candidate.

### Multi-Sig Owner Guidelines

**Number of Signers**

The Multi-Sig ([Gnosis](https://gnosis-safe.io/)) Wallet of IERC DAO is managed by a group of 5 owners. Each transaction necessitates the confirmation of at least 3 out of these 5 owners.

**Requirements for Becoming a Multisig Owner**

To qualify as a Multi-Sig owner, individuals must exhibit a prompt response time to prevent financial bottlenecks and possess experience within the IERC DAO ecosystem. Prospective owners must meet the following criteria:

- Proficiency in IERC DAO operations;
- Previous involvement as an IERC builder or pre-investor;

**Requesting Transactions**

In case of any payment requirements (e.g., bounty requests), a brief proposal and soft consensus on Discord/Telegram are necessary. It is recommended to consult with the Treasury/Governance Coordinator to assess available budgets.

**Preparation and Execution of Transactions**

All transactions will be shared in #governance or related Telegram chat, ensuring that Multi-Sig owners thoroughly understand the transaction details before endorsing them. Once 3 owners have confirmed the payment, it will be executed automatically.

**Transparency in Treasury Operations**

The financial operations are transparently recorded on the blockchain, with monthly statistical reports on expenditure and revenue published within the IERC DAO community.

## Conclusion

IERC DAO represents a pivotal aspect of the IERC ecosystem, empowering community members to actively contribute to its development and growth. Through transparent governance and community-driven decision-making, IERC DAO ensures that the platform evolves in alignment with the collective vision and goals of its stakeholders.
